## Functionality

The tool structure follows the general structure of each Q tool. Further information can be found in [Q server documentation - Developing tools](https://nzzdev.github.io/Q-server/developing-tools.html).

Here is what the tool looks like on mobile and other devices. The example shows the intermediate seat allocation of the elections in the Netherlands in 2017. It's in German because we do not have multilanguage support (yet).

Q Election Seats uses [svelte3](https://svelte.dev) to render the markup on server-side.

![Seat allocation as shown on other devices](./readme-images/seats_desk.png)
![Seat allocation as shown on mobile](./readme-images/seats_mob.png)

Each graphic has the following three sections:

- Header: contains specified title and subtitle
- Main Part: displays the seat allocation including the total amount of seats. The legend indicates the correlation of color and party as well as the gained number of seats and the trend information compared to the last elections
- Footer: contains further notes (e.g. how many municipalities already finished counting), source(s) and update information
