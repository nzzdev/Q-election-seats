## Features
Here is what the tool looks like on mobile and other devices. The example shows the intermediate seat allocation of the elections in the Netherlands in 2017. It's in German because we do not have multilanguage support (yet).

Each graphic has the following three sections:
- Header: contains specified title and subtitle
- Main Part: displays the seat allocation including the total amount of seats. The legend indicates the correlation of color and party as well as the gained number of seats and the trend information compared to the last elections
- Footer: contains further notes (e.g. how many municipalities already finished counting), source(s) and update information
